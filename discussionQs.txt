    1. for sections, we could just have a key for each document that gives page number and line number for each section break
        could keep track of other information like this as well? what else might we need to track?

    2. with how I'm tagging it, bold isn't displaying
        what about other kinds of elements? italics? strikethrough? notes?

    3. Jose any advice about keeping track of split words (i.e., split at end of line)?
    
    4. discuss paragraph elements - not sure if from docx we can tell what is a genuine paragraph end versus, e.g., end of page
