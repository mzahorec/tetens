# VPN instructions
- the documentation about VPNs on FSU's websites is not super clear and friendly
- you need to download the CISCO anyconnect client
- to run the CISCO client, do something like: /opt/cisco/anyconnect/bin/vpnui
- in the CISCO client, connect to "vpn.fsu.edu" (this is not the VPN we need to connect to in order to log in to the TEI Publisher instance)
- should prompt 2FA request
